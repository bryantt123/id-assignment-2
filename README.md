# Genshin Quest

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Genshin Quest is made with the purpose of allowing users to keep track of their in-game quests and complete them in time, similar to how a checklist works. In addition to the checklist, users would be able to participate in a Player-vs-Enemy game where they can fight bosses using their strength, experience and weapons earned through completing their quests.
 
## Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

This website is catered for the users of Genshin Impact - especially those who are busy with other commitments such as school or work. By using this website, these users will be motivated to complete all their quests in time and also be able to keep track of all their ongoing quests.

### User Stories
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

- As a low commitment Genshin Impact player, I would want some sort of motivation to complete my quests in addition to the rewards in earn in-game, so that I can feel a bigger sense of accomplishment.
- As a Genshin Impact player who has not logged onto the game in a long time, I would want a way to keep track of all my quests, so that I know which quest I should complete first before proceeding onto the next one.
- As a regular user on Genshin Quest, I want something that makes Genshin Quest different from other checklists, so that I would stick with Genshin Quest instead of using a regular checklist like Microsoft To-do or such.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
