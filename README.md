# Genshin Quest

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Genshin Quest is made with the purpose of allowing users to keep track of their in-game quests and complete them in time, similar to how a checklist works. In addition to the checklist, users can earn experience points and coins through completing quests, and spend coins on buying new characters to customize how they want their own character to be.
 
## Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

This website is catered for the users of Genshin Impact - especially those who are busy with other commitments such as school or work. By using this website, these users will be motivated to complete all their quests in time and also be able to keep track of all their ongoing quests. In addition, users can play around with extra features on the website to make the website more interesting. This includes a character select page where users can select a character that they own and a shop page where users can buy new characters.

### User Stories
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

- As a low commitment Genshin Impact player, I would want some sort of motivation to complete my quests in addition to the rewards in earn in-game, so that I can feel a bigger sense of accomplishment.
- As a Genshin Impact player who has not logged onto the game in a long time, I would want a way to keep track of all my quests, so that I know which quest I should complete first before proceeding onto the next one.
- As a regular user on Genshin Quest, I want something that makes Genshin Quest different from other checklists, so that I would stick with Genshin Quest instead of using a regular checklist like Microsoft To-do.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features

- Sign-up: Users can sign up using their email and desired password as well as input their own username in order to save their quests later on

- Quest List: Users can create a quest that they want to complete, and it can be put into categories marked by the different regions in Genshin Impact.
    - Mark as completed: Users will gain experience points and coins for completing their quests. This will save into RESTdb so that player stats can be tracked.
    - Edit quest: Quests can be edited in case users have a change of mind. This will change the current quest that is stored in RESTdb.
    - Delete quest: Quests can be deleted in case users want to delete them. This will delete the current quest stored in RESTdb.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
